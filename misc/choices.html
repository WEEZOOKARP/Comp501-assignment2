<h2>
	Choices in Security of Open-Source Software
</h2>
<p>
	With Open-Source Software being used more and more in our everyday lives, there are certain steps we can take as individual to mitigate the security risk involved in open-source software. These choices are made to ensure that individuals and organizations keep data safe while using open-source software so it will not become vulnerable to security risks and hazards.&nbsp; This segment will discuss and review choices that can be made to maximise security when using open-source software. &shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;
</p>
<h2>
	Anti-malware technology / software
</h2>
<p>
	Open-source software can come with many security risks. With more and more businesses and companies using open-source software, it is important that these companies protect their own, and their customers information. One choice that can be made to help do this is the use or anti-virus software / applications. &shy;&shy;&shy;In the USA, a survey was conducted to see how many businesses and individuals were affected by malware and suspicious files online. Approximately 65% of those who took the survey replied saying that they had been affected in some way by online cyber threats. Choosing to use some type of anti-malware software / technology reduces this risk significantly as whatever program is used scans the network or device looking for malware. Open-source software can be modified and changed by almost anyone, making it highly likely to contain some sort of cyber threat or malware files used to hack devices or business networks. This is why it is extremely important that companies and individuals that use open-source software use anti-malware software to mitigate the risk of malware infecting their device or program. It is also important that use of open-source software is done cautiously to prevent further risks.
</p>
<h2>
	Use of Software Composition Analysis tool
</h2>
<p>
	For companies dealing with large amounts of code or software, the use of the Software Composition Analysis tool would be beneficial for the security of the business and all its systems. A Software Composition Tool (SCA) tool is a self-operating process which is used to identify code and programs taken from open-source software. The selected downloaded code is then analysed and scanned for any security risks that may be within the code which cannot be seen visually. In other words, it is used when the open-source code would take a long period of time for direct human analysis to look over which would not be productive. It is also likely that the SCA would not miss as many errors / threats in the code as a human analyser would.&nbsp; Results show that SCA is more than 70% accurate for detecting security weak spots within downloaded code and code that is taken from an open source (OSS). Choosing to use the SCA tool would greatly benefit larger businesses / companies who use open-source software as it allows the software to be checked to harmful malware and programs which could pose a risk to the security of user&rsquo;s data, or the business itself it shorter time frames.&nbsp; Another benefit of using SCA is that it also checks the structure and quality of the code ensuring that it will be robust and fulfil the business needs / requirements.
