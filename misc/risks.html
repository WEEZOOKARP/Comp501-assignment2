	Open-source software is widely used and is a generally supported asset.  But “Deloitte’s ‘open mobile survey’ found that 64 per cent of enterprises still view security as a major obstacle to OSS adoption.” (Silic et al., 2015). When looking into the security risks behind open-source software, there are three main categories that these risks fall into which include general security risks, confidentiality risks and integrity risks.
</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>
		<h2>General Security Risks</h2>
    <p>Risks that fall into this category cover most of the generic risks that follow open-source software. This includes topics like the lack of support, expertise and ownership surrounding OSS. When understanding these risks, it is evident that these risks can often be the underlying problem behind more clear-cut risks (Silic et al., 2015). A key area that can expose OSS to security risks are unexpected errors and the inability to handle certain aspects of the desired software. When it comes to these issues in error-control the potential security risks that could arise include the risk of exposing potentially sensitive information which may make it easier for certain attacks to happen, it could also expose a way for an attacker to bypass certain security measures. Along with this it could also compromise the data integrity of the software (Zahedi et al., 2018). To avoid some of these risks, the developers must keep track of the OSS and all its parts and often complete security checks and updates. While this happens, they must also ensure they are following the OSS license. Managing these different components requires legal and technical knowledge. This can be very time consuming, and the developers may lack the personnel, knowledge or effort to keep on top of this. This can leave the software vulnerable to major security risks or license breaches (Duan, 2019). </p>

		<h2>Confidentiality risks</h2>
    <p>Confidentiality risks investigate the potential compromise of the user’s privacy and sensitive information. Often this occurs through unauthorised access to information through OSS. A common way these risks happen is through the original code being altered with malicious code. OSS is rarely made and developed through a controlled environment. Often there are hundreds of people working on developing the software. Due to this, there is a possibility that some of these developers have malicious intentions. It only takes one person to implement malware within the software for the damage to be done. This is why often closed software is seen to be safer, nevertheless there is always the possibility of malware (Sumandeep, 2020). OSS is much more susceptible to vulnerabilities being exposed due to the sheer number of users that have access to the code. There are multiple examples of this occurring, one of which happened through Facebook where they found a vulnerability that led user’s devices to be linked to controlled Dropbox accounts through by using their Facebook accounts to achieve this (Duan, 2019). Another reason behind these potential confidentiality risks is the lack of control around the development of OSS. Anyone can access and alter the code; some people will see this as a benefit but without the necessary oversight there is a risk of security flaws which will further compromise the confidentiality of users and their information.</p>

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
		<h2>Integrity risks</h2>
    <p>Integrity risks follow the reliability of information offered within the OSS. This information could have been changed by accident or with malicious intent can impact the data integrity throughout the OSS. To keep adequate integrity throughout the software, the information must be consistent and accurate. Falling under this category, code access, code integrity and attacks against integrity are all potential security risks that have to be taken into consideration when developing OSS. Similar to the confidentiality risks, changing the source code, whether intentional or not it can introduce new vulnerabilities which may be exploited by attackers. It may also lead to corruption or loss of data. Changing the source code cause parts of the software to be deleted or changed unintentionally affecting the integrity and security of the software. Further under this category are the poor practices that some developers may inhabit. Careless developers may unintentionally introduce further security risks through things such as misconfigurations or inadequate testing. This falls under the code integrity and gives attackers another input and potential vulnerability to expose (Silic, Back, 2016), (Silic et al., 2015). </p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	By identifying and understanding these risks, it will allow OSS developers to attempt to mitigate them to the best of their ability or be prepared for when any of these risks inevitably occur.
